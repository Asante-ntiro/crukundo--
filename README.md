### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack engineer in Kampala, Uganda. I am currently engaged as an engineering fellow at Qala where I am learning daily about Bitcoin and Lightning and building exciting projects on this ecosystem.

#### Projects ####

- **[Paywalled](https://github.com/crukundo/lnd-paywall/)**: A blogging platform powered by the Lightning network so content creators can earn through Bitcoin micropayments.

- **[BTC Payment Processor](https://github.com/tobi-bams/BTC-Payment-Processor)**: A self-hosted bitcoin payment processor that allows businesses and individuals to invoice and accept Bitcoin payments. Features the BIP21 invoice with fallbacks for regular bitcoin addresses and BOLT11 lightning invoices.
